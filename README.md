## Introduction

Natural disasters have had a profound impact on communities and ecosystems globally. Understanding the trends and patterns in natural disaster events is crucial for improving disaster preparedness, response, and mitigation efforts.

This project aims to provide an advanced analysis of natural disaster events using historical data. The analysis covers various types of disasters, their frequency over time, and correlation patterns.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis includes information on different types of disasters recorded from 1900 to 2023. The data is sourced from the International Disaster Database (EM-DAT) of the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED).

## Analysis

### Number of Recorded Natural Disaster Events (1900-2023)

This section analyzes the total number of natural disaster events recorded each year from 1900 to 2023. The analysis reveals a significant increase in the number of recorded events over time.

### Global Number of Reported Disasters by Type per Decade

This section categorizes the number of disasters by type and analyzes their frequency per decade. The stacked bar chart provides a visual representation of the distribution of various disaster types over time.

### Most Common Disaster Types Over Time

This section aggregates the total number of disasters for each type and plots a bar chart to show the most common disaster types from 1900 to 2023.

### Trends in Specific Disaster Types

This section analyzes trends in specific disaster types such as floods, earthquakes, droughts, extreme weather, and wildfires. Line charts are used to visualize the trends over the years.

### Correlation Analysis

This section computes and visualizes the correlation matrix of the dataset. The correlation matrix helps in understanding the relationships between different types of disasters and other variables in the dataset.

### Seasonal Analysis

This section provides a seasonal analysis of disaster events, showing the distribution of disasters across different months. The analysis helps in identifying any seasonal patterns in the occurrence of disasters.



## Summary

1. The overall number of recorded natural disaster events has significantly increased from 1900 to 2023.
2. The increase in disaster events is evident across various disaster types, with notable increases in floods, earthquakes, droughts, and extreme weather events.
3. The number of disasters varies significantly by type, with some types showing more dramatic increases than others.
4. There are correlations between certain disaster types and years, indicating possible patterns or common causes.
5. The seasonal analysis suggests some months may experience higher numbers of disasters, though more detailed data is needed for a robust analysis.

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals a clear upward trend in the recording of natural disaster events over the past century. This increase can be attributed to multiple factors, including climate change, better reporting mechanisms, and increased awareness and monitoring. Further research is required to understand the specific causes and to develop strategies for disaster risk reduction and resilience building.

The findings highlight the importance of continued data collection and analysis to inform policy decisions and to mitigate the impacts of natural disasters on communities worldwide.
